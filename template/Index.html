    <p> WATCHES THAT COMPLIMENT YOUR STYLE</p>
  </div>
  <p class="plan">Watches do not only help you keep track of time but also make a strong style statement. They add wings
    to your style and personality. <br>Like a sultry dress or a pair of flawless shoes, wrist watches enhance your whole
    appearance. But before you go on making the <br>purchase, you must decide what would be the best watch to suit your
    personality.</p>
  <div class="plan">
    <h2>TYPES OF WATCHES AT FASTRACK</h2>
    <h3>DIGITAL-ANALOGUE WATCHES</h3>
    <p>What if we tell you that you can get the classic look of an analogue watch combined with the features of a
      digital watch? Sounds like a perfect combination, doesnâ€™t it? Our collection of digital-analogue watches is just
      that! With classic numerical dials and small digital screens, these watches come with a 5 ATM water resistance.
    </p>
    <h4>SMARTWATCHES</h4>
    <p>They are the new generation wrist watches. In addition to telling the time and keeping track of activities, these
      watches can be your trainer, your virtual assistant, and your mobile device, all wrapped up around your wrist. Our
      smartwatch collections come packed with features like 24x7 heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen and sleep tracking,
      stress monitoring, and 20+ sports modes. In addition to this, once paired with your smartphone, you can also
      receive notifications, react to texts, play music, and do so much more.</p>
    <h3>YOUR GUIDE TO PICKING THE PERFECT TIMEPIECE</h3>
    <p>We all have a unique sense of style that makes us stand out from the crowd. It is reflected in the kind of
      clothes we wear, the pair of shoes we pick, and the way we accessorise the entire outfit. All of this speaks
      volumes about who we are, so it is obvious that each piece of jewellery, clothing, and accessories we own is
      carefully picked out. So here we are, with some tips to help you decide what kind of watch would best fit your
      aesthetic.</p>
    <h3>YOUR BUDGET</h3>
    <p>Determining how much are you willing to spend on a timepiece is very crucial. We do not want you to get your
      heart set on a piece, only to be turned away by the price tag. So, our suggestion is to decide what your budget is
      and then look at options that are available for you.</p>
